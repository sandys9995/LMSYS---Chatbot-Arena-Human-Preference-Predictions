# LMSYS---Chatbot-Arena-Human-Preference-Predictions
## Project Description

Welcome to our project focused on enhancing the user experience with large language models (LLMs). As LLMs become more integral to our daily interactions, it's essential to ensure their responses align with user preferences. Our project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging a comprehensive dataset from Chatbot Arena, where users chat with two anonymous LLMs and select their preferred responses.

### Objective
Our goal is to predict which response a user will favor in these head-to-head LLM encounters. This involves developing robust "reward models" or "preference models" within the framework of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

### Challenge
Existing research indicates that directly prompting LLMs for preference predictions is limited by various biases:
- **Position Bias**: Favoring the first response presented.
- **Verbosity Bias**: Preferring more verbose responses.
- **Self-Enhancement Bias**: Favoring self-promotional responses.

### Approach
We are exploring diverse machine-learning techniques to build models that effectively predict user preferences. By doing so, we aim to develop LLMs capable of tailoring responses to individual preferences, enhancing the user-friendliness and acceptance of AI-powered conversational systems.

### Impact
This project is pivotal in advancing the capabilities of LLMs, ensuring their responses are more aligned with user expectations. Our efforts will lead to improved user experience and satisfaction, making AI interactions more intuitive and engaging.

Join us in this exciting venture to push the boundaries of AI and create more responsive, user-centric conversational models!
