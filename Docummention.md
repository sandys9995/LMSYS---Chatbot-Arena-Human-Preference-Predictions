# Kaggle Project

## Overview:

### Step 1: Setting Up the Project Environment
- **Create a Project Directory:** Organize your project files.
- **Install Necessary Libraries:** Install libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, and `transformers`.

### Step 2: Data Exploration
- **Load the Data:** Load the `train.csv` file and inspect its structure.
- **Basic Statistics:** Compute basic statistics to understand the data distribution.
- **Visualise Data:** Use visualisations to explore data patterns.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- **Clean the Data:** Handle missing values and clean the text data.
- **Tokenisation and Lemmatization:** Prepare text data for modelling.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract meaningful features from the text.

### Step 4: Model Development
- **Baseline Model:** Implement a simple logistic regression model.
- **Advanced Models:** Implement advanced models like BERT.

### Step 5: Model Evaluation
- **Evaluate Models:** Evaluate models using log loss.
- **Bias Analysis:** Analyze and mitigate biases in the model.

### Step 6: Ensemble and Submission
- **Ensemble Techniques:** Combine multiple models for better performance.
- **Prepare Submission:** Format and submit predictions.

## Starting with Deep Data Pre-processing:

### Text Cleaning:
- **Remove Punctuation:** Strip out punctuation marks.
- **Lowercase Conversion:** Convert all text to lowercase for uniformity.
- **Stop Words Removal:** Remove common stop words to reduce noise.

### Advanced Tokenization:
- **N-grams:** Create bi-grams or tri-grams for capturing context.
- **Stemming and Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their base forms.

### Handling Special Characters and Emojis:
- **Remove or Replace Special Characters:** Handle any special characters or emojis appropriately.

### Text Vectorization:
- **TF-IDF:** Convert text data to numerical data using TF-IDF.
- **Word Embeddings:** Use pre-trained embeddings like GloVe, Word2Vec, or transformer-based embeddings.

### Feature Extraction:
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment of each response.
- **Readability Scores:** Calculate readability metrics (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid).
- **Response Length:** Include features for response length and prompt length.

### Handling Class Imbalance:
- **Resampling Techniques:** Apply techniques like SMOTE if there is a class imbalance.

## Feature Engineering Steps

### Sentiment Analysis:
- Compute sentiment scores for the prompts and responses using libraries like `TextBlob` or `VADER`.

### Readability Scores:
- Calculate readability metrics (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) for the responses to gauge complexity.

### Response Length:
- Create features for the length of prompts and responses (e.g., number of words, characters).

### Word Embeddings:
- Use pre-trained embeddings (e.g., GloVe, Word2Vec) to convert text data into dense vectors.

### N-grams:
- Generate bi-grams and tri-grams to capture context in responses.

### Positional Bias:
- Create a feature indicating the position of responses to handle positional bias.

### Topic Modeling:
- Use LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to identify topics in the prompts and responses.

### Semantic Similarity:
- **Cosine Similarity:** Measure the similarity between the prompt and each response.
- **Jaccard Similarity:** Calculate the similarity in terms of word overlap.

### Syntactic Features:
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tags:** Distribution of POS tags in the responses.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Count of named entities in responses.

### Response Characteristics:
- **Question Count:** Number of questions in responses.
- **Politeness:** Use a politeness classifier to score responses.

### Interaction Dynamics:
- **Prompt-Response Pair Analysis:** Feature interaction terms between prompts and responses.
